## Overview

*SDiagonalizability.jl* implements the first non-naÃ¯ve deterministic algorithm to minimize the ``S``-bandwidth of an undirected graph with integer edge weights.

Given an undirected, possibly weighted graph ``G`` and finite set of integers ``S \subset \mathbb{Z}``, ``G`` is said to be "``S``-diagonalizable" if there exists some diagonal matrix ``D`` and matrix ``P`` with all entries from ``S`` such that ``G``'s Laplacian matrix ``L(G) = PDP^{-1}``. If ``G`` is ``S``-diagonalizable, then its "``S``-bandwidth" is the minimum integer ``k \in \{1, 2, \ldots, |V(G)|\}`` such that there exists some diagonal matrix ``D`` and matrix ``P`` with all entries from ``S`` such that ``L(G) = PDP^{-1}`` and ``[P^\mathsf{T}P]_{i,j} = 0`` whenever ``|i - j| \geq k``; otherwise, its ``S``-bandwidth is simply ``\infty``.

For specific choices of ``S`` (namely ``\{-1, 1\}`` and ``\{-1, 0, 1\}``), the ``S``-bandwidth of a quantum network has been shown to be an indicator of high state transfer fidelity due to automorphic properties of the graph. As such, the nascent study of ``S``-diagonalizability and ``S``-bandwidth is of interest in the broader context of quantum information theory.

## Installation

The only prerequisite is a working Julia installation (v1.10 or later). First, enter Pkg mode by typing `]` in the Julia REPL, then run the following command:

```julia-repl
pkg> add https://github.com/GraphQuantum/SDiagonalizability.jl
```

Once *SDiagonalizability.jl* is added to Julia's General package registry, you will be able to install it more easily with:

```julia-repl
pkg> add SDiagonalizability
```

## Basic use

[TODO: Write here]

## Documentation

The full documentation is available at [GitHub Pages](https://graphquantum.github.io/SDiagonalizability.jl/). Documentation for methods and types is also available via the Julia REPL. [TODO: Write here]

## Citing

We encourage you to cite our work if you have used our algorithm in your research. Starring the *SDiagonalizability.jl* repository on GitHub is also appreciated.

The latest citation information may be found in the [CITATION.bib](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GraphQuantum/SDiagonalizability.jl/main/CITATION.bib) file within the repository.

## Project status

We aim to release the first stable version of *SDiagonalizability.jl* sometime in early August 2025. The current codebase is a work-in-progress, with the main `SDiagonalizability` module not yet functional and comprehensive documentation/tests not yet available.
